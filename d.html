        <h1>Deep Quotes & Poetic Reflections</h1>
         <p class="subtitle">A collection of original deep quotes and poetic reflections by Tahmina.</p>
        <p>Words have the power to shape perspectives, ignite emotions, and leave lasting impressions. With a passion for depth and insight, I craft thought-provoking quotes that resonate with the human experience. My words are designed to inspire, challenge, and empower those who seek meaning beyond the surface.</p>
        
        <h2>Deep Quotes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"You don't always need a change; you just need an improvement."</li>
            <li>"You don't know my achievements, so don't judge me by my failures."</li>
            <li>"Failures are written on your path, but how you react to them is what truly defines you."</li>
            <li>"Lies can be caught, but tellers are less where justice can be given, but believers are less."</li>
            <li>"Being courageous is bravery in disguise."</li>
            <li>"Everyone has eyes, but not every eye can see the truth."</li>
            <li>"It is good to have suffering, pain, and scars in one's life, for they fade away arrogance and remind one to be humble."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Poetic Reflections</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"All that’s left to do in life is believe and march forward… for me, I shall move forward through that door I have spoken of. It was there, and so was I. We both remained, unmoved, until now. My legs are giving in, so I must walk, and that door that was there all along could now rest for long."</li>
            <li>"You’re chasing proof—proof that you’re good enough, proof that you’ll make it, proof that your efforts will pay off. But what if I told you that who you are right now is already proof?"</li>
            <li>"Balancing ambition with self-acknowledgment… The challenge is not just in achieving, but in allowing yourself to feel that you’ve arrived, even when the next level still calls to you."</li>
            <li>"Why do I seek answers so deeply? Because you cannot truly feel or write unless you know why. And so, I flow like that in life—always chasing the why."</li>
            <li>"The storm has passed, and the skies are calm… but only for a while before the winds pick up again. And so, I move, because stillness was never mine to keep."</li>
        </ul>
